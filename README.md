# Control-System-Design-and-Simulation
This repository contains solutions to control system problems involving **PD and PID controller design, system response analysis, and performance verification**. The implementation includes transfer function derivations, stability analysis, and time-domain simulations. All codes and models are structured for reproducibility and validation.
